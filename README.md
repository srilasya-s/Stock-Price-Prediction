# 📈 Stock Price Prediction

A Jupyter Notebook-based project exploring stock price modeling with financial algorithms, including the Black–Scholes model.

---

## 🔍 Overview

This repository contains a Jupyter notebook (`Monte Claro Black Scholes Project.ipynb`) that:
- Demonstrates historical stock data analysis  
- Uses the **Black–Scholes option pricing model**  
- Explains model assumptions, inputs, outputs, and example computations  

---

## 🧰 Requirements

- Python 3.7+
- Jupyter Notebook
- Core libraries:
  ```bash
  pip install numpy pandas matplotlib scipy yfinance

Clone the repo
